# Getting-Ready-for-Physics-Class

You are a physics teacher preparing for the upcoming semester. You want to provide your students with some functions that will help them calculate some fundamental physical properties.

- Write a function called f_to_c that takes an input f_temp, a temperature in Fahrenheit, and converts it to c_temp, that temperature in Celsius.
- Define a variable f100_in_celsius and set it equal to the value of f_to_c with 100 as an input.
- Write a function called c_to_f that takes an input c_temp, a temperature in Celsius, and converts it to f_temp, that temperature in Fahrenheit.
- Define a variable c0_in_fahrenheit and set it equal to the value of c_to_f with 0 as an input.
- Define a function called get_force that takes in mass and acceleration. It should return mass multiplied by acceleration.
- Test get_force by calling it with the variables train_mass and train_acceleration.
- Define a function called get_energy that takes in mass and c.
- Test get_energy by using it on bomb_mass, with the default value of c. Save the result to a variable called bomb_energy.
- Define a final function called get_work that takes in mass, acceleration, and distance.
- Test get_work by using it on train_mass, train_acceleration, and train_distance. Save the result to a variable called train_work.
